# HomePi Application

This is a Paas managment tool for dispersed RaspberyPi devices and includes a full RESTful API for remote management of applications on distributed RaspberyPis . The site is up and running [HomePi.org](http://homepi.org), To be honest though, its another couple weeks away from being usable. The REST API is done and tested with basic functions enabled but the UI is where I am working now.  
    
## Running the application locally

First build with:

    $mvn clean install

Then run it with:

    $ java -cp target/classes:target/dependency/* com.meadowhawk.homepi.LocalMain

Note! This requires some System Properties being set to run as well as a Postgress Database.


-Denv.db.userid=postgres -Denv.db.password=Password1

-Dgoogle_auth_client_secret=google_client_secret
